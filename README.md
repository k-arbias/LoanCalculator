# LoanCalculator

I did a small project using Vanilla JavaScript, for styling I used bootstrap 4.
This project is a Loan Calculator, it calculates the amount you have to return using some math functions 
which calculates the amount you have taken, the interest of the bank and for how many years you want to return the loan.
